This project focuses on developing a DeFi app.

This repository presents practices about:

You can check the quick tutorial about "what is the blockchain?" in [here](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/what-is-blockchain).

## Theory
### What is Banking System in Solidity?
It is a type of safe Banking system build on Ethereum Blockchain. You can perform the following task using the Smart Contract: 
- You can register for an account as and when require.
- Whenever some one creates an account he will be given 2 ETH initially and will be deducted from the account who is creating his account.
- We can add money as and when required.
- We can get all the details of an account like when was the account created and the address of the account.
- We can transfer money from one account to another account.
- We can also get loan from the Bank whenever we want.
- An interest is generated automatically when we take the loan.
- We can get all the transaction details.
- We can also withdraw our Balance as and when required.

Hope so front-end part will be built soon to make this Defi looks real.
